This repo is intended to be a shared practice place for beginners from ENP, to become familiar with competitive programming and participate in IEEEXtreme. 
It is needed to learn the basics of DSA and algorithms design paradigms. This repo may guide you to get started.
You can practice for IEEEXtreme on CS Academy or Leet Code.
Find previous IEEEXtreme problems on: [IEEEXtreme Practice](https://csacademy.com/contest/ieeextreme-practice/tasks/)
You can also prepare for it by:
* Solving problems of similar style: [CS Academy](https://csacademy.com/contest/interview-archive/)
* Solving problems on: [Leet Code](https://leetcode.com/problemset/)

It is important to:
* Learn basic data structures used to solve problems in programming. You can find some lessons on CS Academy: [CS Academy - Lessons](https://csacademy.com/lessons/)
* Learn algorithm design paradigms like: recursion, dynamic programming (tabulation, memoization..), greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, backtracking, graph algorithms, bitwise..etc.
The website "Geeks For Geeks" contains many courses, explained algorithms and solved problems. Links:
